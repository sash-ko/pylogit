@summary:   Contains functions necessary for estimating multinomial scobit
            models (with the help of the "base_multinomial_cm.py" file).
            Differs from version one since it works with the shape, intercept,
            index coefficient partitioning of estimated parameters as opposed
            to the shape, index coefficient partitioning scheme of version 1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    param_vec : 1D ndarray.
        Elements should all be ints, floats, or longs. Should have as many
        elements as there are parameters being estimated.
    rows_to_alts : 2D scipy sparse matrix.
        There should be one row per observation per available alternative and
        one column per possible alternative. This matrix maps the rows of the
        design matrix to the possible alternatives for this dataset. All
        elements should be zeros or ones.
    design : 2D ndarray.

    -------

        intercept parameters for this model or None. The third element will be
        an array of the index coefficients for this model.

    Note
    ----
    If `return_all_types == True` then the function will return a tuple of four
    objects. In order, these objects will either be None or the arrays
    representing the arrays corresponding to the nest, shape, intercept, and

    zero_vector : 1D ndarray.
        Determines what is viewed as a "null" set of parameters. It is
        explicitly passed because some parameters (e.g. parameters that must be
        greater than zero) have their null values at values other than zero.
    split_params : callable.

        model_obj.design as arguments. Should return a tuple containing
        separate arrays for the model's shape, outside intercept, and index

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : string or pandas dataframe.
        If string, data should be an absolute or relative path to a CSV file
        containing the long format data for this choice model. Note long format
        is has one row per available alternative for each observation. If
        pandas dataframe, the dataframe should be the long format data for the
        choice model.
    alt_id_col :str.
        Should denote the column in data which contains the alternative
        identifiers for each row.
    obs_id_col : str.
        Should denote the column in data which contains the observation
        identifiers for each row.
    choice_col : str.
        Should denote the column in data which contains the ones and zeros that
        denote whether or not the given row corresponds to the chosen
        alternative for the given individual.
    specification : OrderedDict.
        Keys are a proper subset of the columns in `data`. Values are either a
        list or a single string, "all_diff" or "all_same". If a list, the
        elements should be:
            - single objects that are in the alternative ID column of `data`
            - lists of objects that are within the alternative ID column of
              `data`. For each single object in the list, a unique column will
              be created (i.e. there will be a unique coefficient for that
              variable in the corresponding utility equation of the
              corresponding alternative). For lists within the
              `specification` values, a single column will be created for all
              the alternatives within the iterable (i.e. there will be one
              common coefficient for the variables in the iterable).
    intercept_ref_pos : int, optional.
         Valid only when the intercepts being estimated are not part of the
         index. Specifies the alternative in the ordered array of unique
         alternative ids whose intercept or alternative-specific constant is
         not estimated, to ensure model identifiability. Default == None.
    names : OrderedDict, optional.
        Should have the same keys as `specification`. For each key:
            - if the corresponding value in `specification` is "all_same", then
              there should be a single string as the value in names.
            - if the corresponding value in `specification` is "all_diff", then

              alternative.
            - if the corresponding value in `specification` is a list, then
              there should be a list of strings as the value in names. There

    intercept_names : list, or None, optional.

        elements as there are possible alternatives in data, minus 1. Each
        element of the list should be a string--the name of the corresponding

            parameter being estimated. Shape parameters should come before

            `init_intercepts` if `"intercept"` is not in the utility
            specification, and `init_coefs`.
        init_shapes : 1D ndarray or None, optional.
            The initial values of the shape parameters. All elements should be
            ints, floats, or longs. There should be one parameter per possible
            alternative id in the dataset. This keyword argument will be

            The passed values for this argument will be ignored if `init_vals`
            is not None. This keyword argument should only be used if
            `"intercept"` is not in the utility specification. Default == None.
        init_coefs : 1D ndarray or None, optional.
            The initial values of the index coefficients. There should be one
            coefficient per index variable. The passed values for this argument
            will be ignored if `init_vals` is not None. Default == None.
        print_res : bool, optional.
            Determines whether the timing and initial and final log likelihood
            results will be printed as they they are determined.
            Default `== True`.
        method : str, optional.
            Should be a valid string for scipy.optimize.minimize. Determines
            the optimization algorithm that is used for this problem.
            Default `== 'bfgs'`.
        loss_tol : float, optional.
            Determines the tolerance on the difference in objective function
            values from one iteration to the next that is needed to determine
            convergence. Default `== 1e-06`.
        gradient_tol : float, optional.
            Determines the tolerance on the difference in gradient values from
            one iteration to the next which is needed to determine convergence.

        maxiter : int, optional.

            Default `== 1000`.
        ridge : int, float, long, or None, optional.
            Determines whether or not ridge regression is performed. If a
            scalar is passed, then that scalar determines the ridge penalty for
            the optimization. The scalar should be greater than or equal to
            zero. Default `== None`.
        constrained_pos : list or None, optional.
